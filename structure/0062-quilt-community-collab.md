# Summary

This document intends to describe the Quilt Community Collab Program, as well as its entry requirements, processes, and the roles that may be assigned to its members.

# Motivation

The Minecraft community is complex and diverse and, in order to keep everyone safe, it's often useful for communities to share information with each other. The main goal of the Quilt Community Collab Program is to facilitate this information-sharing between a selected group of communities, which have been vetted for trustworthiness and educated on the best way to approach this type of data.

The Minecraft community at large has long been host to a surprisingly high amount of hatred and discrimination, and the Quilt Community Collab Program is one of our ways of giving back to the community that got us where we are --- with the aim of hopefully improving it for everyone.

# Definitions

This document refers to a number of abstract concepts below. For the purposes of this document, they should be understood as follows.

## Community staff roles

* A **community moderator** is someone that's part of a community's staff team, and whose work is focused on moderating its community spaces, rather than maintaining those spaces at a structural or technical level, or managing other staff team roles
* A **community administrator** is someone that's part of a community's staff team, and whose work focuses on maintaining its community spaces at a structural or technical level, or managing other staff team roles, rather than moderating those spaces
    
While an administrator may also be a moderator, many administrators do not engage in moderation -- for the purposes of this document, it's important to make a distinction here; mentions of community administrators below will refer to administrators who do not moderate, and mentions of community moderators will include administrators that also handle moderation

## Other definitions

* A **Program member** is anyone that's taking part in the Quilt Community Collab program --- specifically anyone with the Individual Collaborator, Collaborator or Manager role.

# Explanation

The Quilt Community Collab Program (henceforth, "the Program") largely exists as a private Discord server, wherein representatives from participating Minecraft-related communities exchange information and coordinate on issues of moderation, alongside individual contributors that don't represent specific communities.

It also exists to serve as a coordination point for events and other cross-community projects within the Minecraft sphere.

## What the Program is not

* An official, direct affiliation with the Quilt project, or any other community that participates in the Program
* A space for building or coordinating the character assassinations of community members or prominent personalities
* A space meant for blindly synchronizing punishments between communities
  * Instead, each community must decide on appropriate moderation actions for their own spaces, which may be informed by the data they're given access to, but not blindly copied between communities --- Breaking this rule is likely to result in a community being removed from the Program

## Program Roles

As the Program exists largely on Discord, the roles of its members are directly represented by Discord server roles.

### Keyholder

The Keyholder for this space is the same as for the other Quilt spaces. This role is described in the Keyholders section of [RFC 7: Community Team](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/structure/0007-community-team.md#keyholders), and works in the same way.

### Managers

Managers are responsible for keeping the Program up-and-running. They take care of the following tasks, among other things:

* Maintaining, organizing, and actioning changes to the Program's Discord server, and any other Program-related spaces
* Organizing polls and votes, as required by formal procedures
* Aiding in conflict resolution between communities and Program members, and acting as moderators of Program spaces when necessary
* Staying in touch (and maintaining relations) with the communities that are part of the Program
* Procuring and maintaining any services that the Program needs to function properly

This role is very similar to the Community Manager role within Quilt's own Community Team.

### Collaborators

The Collaborator role is given to moderators from the communities that are part of the Program, and who have joined a Program-related space in order to represent their communities. Administrators from these communities are welcome to join as Collaborators as well, if they wish.

Collaborators are given access to all moderation-related areas within Program spaces, such as general moderation chat channels and case-tracking threads. Additionally, all Collaborators are granted access to spaces dedicated to organizing events between participating communities.

### Individual Collaborators

The Individual Collaborator role is given to moderators (and others) that have joined the Program, but do not represent any specific community, which may be for any number of reasons. We believe that Individual Collaborators should be able to make use of the Program, and can contribute to it just how regular Collaborators can.

Individual Collaborators are given the same level of access that regular Collaborators are given. Individual Collaborators are granted veto rights but, as the voting process happens at a community level, they are not currently given voting rights.

### Event Planners

The Event Planner role is given to members of participating communities' community teams that focus on event creation, execution and management. They do not have access to moderation-related areas within Program spaces, and are instead given their own dedicated spaces.

### Project Roles

Project-specific roles may be created and granted to Program members that are contributing to (or participating in) Program-related projects. The definition of these roles will depend on the project in question, and they'll be created or granted on an as-needed basis.

These roles aren't detailed in this RFC, as they don't impact how the Program functions.

### Invitees

Invitees are temporary users with no access to Program-related spaces, other than temporary areas that are created for whatever purpose they're visiting the respective space.

## Voting process

Votes may be called by Program Managers, where each of the communities participating in the Program represent the poll's voters. As the Program exists largely on Discord, a poll and an associated thread are created on the Program's Discord server, in a channel designated for this purpose.

The poll should be as detailed as possible in order to help everyone to make an informed decision. Discussions related to the poll should happen in the associated thread, to try to keep everything together.

Each community is assigned one single vote. Individual communities are responsible for coming up with their own process for determining their vote, but it must follow these rules:

* The process must be democratic and give a voice to any community member that is otherwise eligible to join the Program's Discord server under the Collaborator role, even if they're not currently present on the server
* Each eligible member of the community must have equal voting power
* Eligible members may only be excluded via a reasonable inactivity threshold
* The process must be formally documented somewhere, but this documentation may be kept internal to the given community
* Participating communities must allow the Program's Manager team to audit their process, which may be motivated by reports from the given community's members, or from other Program members, including the Managers themselves

Once a community has decided how it's going to vote, it must designate a single eligible community member to represent that vote. This representative must report their community's vote in the associated thread, specifically mentioning the community's name and the option being voted for, and providing proof of the results --- such as a screenshot of an internal poll.

Participating communities also have the option of abstaining from the vote. This must either be reported in the thread as described above or, in the case of a community that wishes to abstain from all votes, directly to a Program Manager in advance. Regardless of the method, documented consensus among eligible community members must be provided.

All polls must include a closing date that is set at least ten days into the future. If needed, this date may be pushed back by up to a month, as long as an informal agreement between the majority of the Program's participating, non-abstaining communities has been reached, and documented within the thread associated with the poll.

At any point before the poll has closed, any Collaborator can use their right to veto, if allowed by the process. This right is described below.

Once the poll has been closed, the vote should be interpreted as described by the process the poll is a part of.

**Note:** Individual Collaborators currently do not hold the right to vote.

### The right to veto

While a poll is open and accepting votes, any Individual Collaborator, Collaborator or Manager can use their right to veto by sending a message to the associated thread, detailing why they'd like to veto the vote.

If another Collaborator or Manager isn't satisfied with the reasoning behind the veto, they can attempt to overrule it. To start this process, a new poll is created to allow voters to decide whether to overrule the veto. This poll lasts for three days and, if more than half of the individual votes are positive, the veto is overruled. If this vote fails, the original vote should be treated as if it has failed.

As the veto process is operated at an individual level, Program members vote as individuals. Communities are not required to seek consensus and vote as a whole.

If nobody attempts to overrule the veto before the original vote ends, the original vote should be treated as if it has failed. If someone attempts to overrule the veto, then the original vote will not be closed until the vote to overrule has ended, even if the vote to overrule finishes after the end date for the original vote.

The veto process may be started on behalf of another Manager or Collaborator. Additionally, the list of voters on that veto may be kept secret. This is intended to avoid exposing those that started or supported the veto (or that didn't) to negative reactions or bullying by other Program members.

## Process: Adding a community

Any Minecraft-related community may apply to join the Program --- but, given that the Program itself largely exists on Discord, it's easier for us to work with Discord-oriented communities.

### Evaluation criteria

Communities that apply to the Program are evaluated based on a number of criteria, which are examined and discussed by the existing Program members during the application. These criteria include, but are not limited to:

* The main focus of the community
* Why the community wishes to join the Program
* How competently the community has been set up
* The community's rules and approaches to moderation
* Who is part of the community's staff team
* Whether the community has any known, relevant history

### Application process

The application process is defined as follows:

1. An administrator or moderator from the community that wishes to apply (henceforth, "the new community") must get in touch with a Manager from the Program to start the process. The following information is collected by the manager:
    * The name and main focus of the community
    * Why the community wishes to join the Program
    * What the community rules are (or where to find them)
    * A full list of staff members and their roles
    * A method of accessing the community directly (for example, a Discord server invitation)
    * A statement that shows that this RFC (and all other relevant public documentation) has been read and understood
    * Whether the community intends to be part of the voting process and, if so, documentation on how that community will follow the voting process (or a commitment to figuring that out before the community may vote on anything)
2. Once the above information has been provided, a Manager informs all Program members on the Discord server, and opens a discussion thread to figure out how the Program members feel about the new community, and to discuss anything relevant to the application
3. A Discord channel is set up to allow the administrators and moderators from the new community (who are to be invited and given the Invitee role) to talk with existing Program members regarding their application
4. Once the voting-eligible Program members have informally agreed that enough information has been gathered, the vote may be created (with options to approve or deny the vote) --- it must be done in a channel the Invitees don't have access to, and follow the voting process outlined earlier in this document
5. Once the vote has concluded, the discussion channel must be archived and kept read-only, so it can be reviewed later on if needed

### Interpreting the vote

**The vote has passed** when more than 75% of the votes cast at the time of closing are positive. Internal discussions can be removed as needed before the new community is given access to the rest of the server. The new community should also be added to any relevant listings.

Otherwise, **the vote has failed.** Enough time should be given to the Invitees to acknowledge the result and leave the server, but Managers are free to kick them if they don't leave in a timely fashion.

## Process: Adding an Individual Collaborator

Anyone who has experience with moderation or who may be able to contribute productively to the Program may apply to join it. As the Program itself largely exists on Discord, all Individual Collaborators must be present on the Program's Discord server.

This process matches the process for adding a community. However, some guidelines on how to evaluate an Individual Collaborator applicant have been provided below.

### Evaluation criteria

Individuals that apply to the program are evaluated based on a number of criteria, which are examined and discussed by the existing Program members during the application. These criteria include, but are not limited to:

* Why the applicant wishes to join the program
* The applicant's personal views on social issues
* The applicant's known approaches to moderation, and the communities they've worked with
* How the applicant has behaved in the communities that the Program members have access to
* How well-known the applicant is among Program members
* Whether the applicant has any known, relevant history

## Process: Removing a community

While we hope that it won't ever be necessary, it's important that we have the ability to remove communities from the program if it should ever become necessary.

### Starting the process

This process is largely Manager-driven. The Manager team may decide to start this process due to concerns shared with them (by anyone) or events witnessed by them directly --- included, but not limited to:

* Substantiated concerns regarding a community's staff teams perpetuating harmful behaviour --- such as paedophilia, physical violence, or ableism, racism, transphobia or other bigotry
* Sudden changes in community leadership with no appropriate reasoning, or a problematic agenda
* Changes in community rules or purpose, such that the community no longer fits into the program

This is not an exhaustive list, but the related discussions that happen as part of this process are free to debate the reasoning for the call for removal if needed. However, the removal process is unlikely to be an appropriate resolution for issues that may be easily addressed through communication with the community in question.

### Removal process

The removal process is defined as follows:

1. If required, the Manager team may replace the roles currently granted to the representatives from the community in question with the Invitee role --- This must be communicated to those representatives, but the Managers are not required to communicate the reason if they believe it's not the best course of action
2. The Manager team must post a message visible to the rest of the Program's members, clearly explaining the concerns and the reasoning behind starting the removal process, and with an associated discussion thread --- this message and thread must not be visible to the representatives of the community in question
3. Once the voting-eligible Program members have informally agreed that everyone's had enough time to read the message and ask questions, the vote may be created (with options to approve or deny the vote) --- it must follow the voting process outlined earlier in this document, but **it is not eligible to be vetoed by Program members**
4. Once the vote has concluded, the discussion channel must be archived and kept read-only, so it can be reviewed later on if needed

### Interpreting the vote

**The vote has passed** when more than 50% of the votes cast at the time of closing are positive. The community is removed from the Program and any listings therein.

Otherwise, **the vote has failed.** Internal discussions can be removed as needed. The community is reintegrated, and any roles that were removed are returned.

## Process: Removing an Individual Collaborator

While we hope that it won't ever be necessary, it's important that we have the ability to remove Individual Collaborators from the program if it should ever become necessary.

This process matches the process for removing a community.

# Rationale and alternatives

The Quilt Community Collab Program existed before this document was written. Therefore, this document tries to formalize its processes, and summarize how it works. This includes providing concrete standards for processes that were informal until now.

Several relevant votes were held on the Program's Discord server leading up to the production of this document. They are as follows:

1. When voting on whether to add or remove a community, how should the votes be counted?
    - **10 answered:** One vote per community; each community will be required to formalize an internal voting process to figure out what their vote should be, and it must be democratic and fair
    - **4 answered:** One vote per collaborator; each user or plural system present on the Discord server gets one vote

2. What ratio of votes should be required to pass a membership vote?
    - **11 answered:** > 75% approval to pass
    - **4 answered:** > 50% approval to pass
    - **1 answered:** 100% approval to pass

3. For membership votes, should we have veto rights? If so, how should that work?
   - **17 answered:** Any voter can veto, which can be overruled by the majority if the concerns aren't considered worthwhile enough to fail the vote
   - **0 answered:** Any voter can veto, which will immediately fail the vote
   - **0 answered:** There should be no veto rights

4. Should we allow for external collaborators (now Individual Collaborators) that don't represent any specific community?
    - **21 voted:** Yes
    - **4 voted:** I don't care
    - **0 voted:** No

# Prior art

The Quilt Community Collab Program is a spiritual successor to an older program named Discord INTERPOL, a now-defunct private Discord server. This program intended to provide a way for notable Discord communities in the Fabric sphere to share information on incoming community threats and inform its members on issues of moderation. 

Discord INTERPOL had many similarities with the Quilt Community Collab Program, including many of its foci and members. However, it lacked the support it needed from larger communities and didn't have the backing of a mod-loader project, which made it difficult to grow to a size that would see it become more widely useful.

Additionally, the Quilt Community Collab Program has a much broader focus --- attempting to educate its members on running their communities, and providing spaces to talk about general community management, defensive moderation tooling, wider social issues, and event planning.

# Unresolved questions

For the sake of getting this process document completed within a reasonable amount of time, the following concerns will need to be addressed at a later date:

* ~~We haven't discussed how new Managers should be added, which is an issue due to the fact that all Program Managers are also Quilt Community Managers; a more representative level of power-sharing should be worked on.~~ This question has been resolved by [RFC 0073: Quilt Community Collab Manager Elections](/structure/0073-qcc-manager-elections.md).
