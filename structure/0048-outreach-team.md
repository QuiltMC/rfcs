# Outreach Team

This document has been made according to the process outlined in [RFC
0006][RFC6].

## Summary

The Outreach Team is a subteam of the Community Team in charge of outreach
and communications within and outside the Quilt Project. This team is also
responsible for working with the development teams to communicate the
current status of development progress with the community and with any
partners. In essence, it may be thought of as a "public relations
department" of sorts.

## Motivation

This team is needed because developers would rather focus on development than
on public relations, status updates, announcements, or team to-do lists.
Historically, this has been managed by the Community Team as a whole.
However, communications don't fall within the realm of the current Quilt
community team, and thus this should have its own separate subteam.

## Explanation

The Outreach Team will be responsible for all communications outside of and
within the Quilt Project. This is difficult to define without providing
specific examples, which include:

- writing and publishing blog posts and announcements
- managing the official QuiltMC social medias, with the exception of Discord
- managing relations with other platforms and communities outside of a
  moderation context
- writing and publishing general status updates on the progress and
  development of Quilt
- assisting in management of public development boards and to-do lists,
  including GitHub project boards
- managing the content of the website, not including the functionality
- leading and creating agendas/minutes for developer meetings, alongside the
  events team

## Drawbacks

This team in and of itself may still be too broad, depending on how it is
approached. It may be split up into several subteams, including a blog team
or a social media team.

Relations with external communities may already be covered by the
responsibilities of Community Managers and the community collaboration
program. However, the community collaboration program is supposed to be in
more of a moderation and community safety context, whereas the outreach
team would not be handling this.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Most of the responsibilities outlined for the Outreach Team are already done
by the Community Team. The scope of that team is too wide, however, and
these responsibilities do not necessarily fall within the its intended scope.

Similarly to the separation of community and developer teams, separation of
concerns in the form of a outreach team is a necessity because this is
currently an underdeveloped area. Without a separate team for it,
communications and outreach are always going to be an issue within the Quilt
Project.

## Prior Art

The concept of a [public relations][PR] department in a company or organization
is a rather common one. The Outreach Team is intended to fill this role.
