# Communications Team

This document has been made according to the process outlined in [RFC
0006][RFC6].

## Summary

The Communications Team is the team in charge of communications within and
outside the Quilt Project. This team is also responsible for working with the
development teams to communicate the current status of development progress
with the community and with any partners. In essence, it may be thought of as
a "public relations department" of sorts.

## Motivation

This team is needed because developers would rather focus on development than
on public relations, status updates, or team to-do lists. Historically, this
has been managed by the Community Team. However, that team's scope is already
wide enough. Communications fall outside the realm of the Quilt community, and
thus this should have its own separate team.

## Explanation

The Communications Team will be responsible for all communications outside of
and within the Quilt Project. This is difficult to define without providing
specific examples, which include:

- writing and publishing blog posts
- managing the official QuiltMC social medias, with the exception of Discord,
  and not including moderation
- managing relations with other platforms and communities outside of a
  moderation context
- writing and publishing general status updates on the progress and
  development of Quilt
- assisting in management of public development boards and to-do lists,
  including GitHub project boards
- managing the content of the website, not including the functionality
- leading and creating agendas/minutes for developer meetings, alongside the
  events team

## Drawbacks

This team in and of itself may still be too broad, depending on how it is
approached. It may be split up into several subteams, including a blog team
or a social media team.

Relations with external communities may already be covered by the
responsibilities of Community Managers and the community collaboration
program. However, the community collaboration program is supposed to be in
more of a moderation and community safety context, whereas the communications
team would not be handling this.

## Rationale and Alternatives

Most of the responsibilities outlined for the Communications Team are already
done by the Community Team. The scope of that team is too wide, however, and
these responsibilities do not necessarily fall within the its intended scope.

Similarly to the separation of community and developer teams, separation of
concerns in the form of a communications team is a necessity because this is
currently an underdeveloped area. Without a separate team for it,
communications and public relations are always going to be an issue within the
Quilt Project.

## Prior Art

The concept of a [public relations][PR] department in a company or organization
is a rather common one. The Communications Team is intended to fill this role.
