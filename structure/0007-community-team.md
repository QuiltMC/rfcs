# Summary

This document exists to describe the formation of a team that handles Quilt's community management tasks. It makes 
reference to **the Quilt community**, which may be defined as all official Quilt community spaces, including (but not 
limited to):

* The QuiltMC GitHub organisation and repositories
* The official Quilt Discord server
* The official Quilt wiki

**Note:** Unordered lists in this document have been alphabetized to emphasise the fact that, in most cases, entries
in those lists are of equal importance.


# Motivation

Community management is an extremely important task, especially so for community-driven projects like Quilt. 
Maintaining a healthy community should always be a top priority, and a team should be formed to handle Quilt's
community aspects as best it can.

While most of the work the community team will do will not be directly relevant to Quilt's development efforts,
its members must be prepared to deal with issues in development-related spaces that fall within the team's scope.

## Advantages and Benefits

A community-driven project exists to serve its community's needs. The only way this is an achievable goal is to
maintain a healthy, safe and involved community - with dedicated community spaces, and a dedicated management team.

It should be understood that an active, healthy community has many benefits - not all of which are easy to enumerate
in a document, or which directly concern the project in an obvious way. That said, the following benefits should be
fairly observable from an active, healthy community:

* A higher chance of obtaining sponsorships that allow the project to grow beyond its technical bounds
* A larger pool of feedback to work with, as well as more opportunities to work with the community on solutions to
  issues
* A larger pool of potential contributors, for development projects and otherwise
* Improved project recognition and reputation within modding spaces, as well as within the wider development- and 
  game-related spaces worldwide
* More opportunities for collaboration with the rest of the modding community
* More opportunities to improve the modding ecosystem as a whole
* More opportunities to support the members of our community in ways that are meaningful to them


# Explanation

The Community Team will be in charge of maintaining the Quilt community spaces, as detailed in the summary. It will
be responsible for drafting up, accepting comments on and implementing community policies, interacting with and
protecting the community and its members, and resolving conflicts and enforcing the community policies. Community Team
members also play a large role when it comes to community engagement, and team members should be prepared to plan
events and generally engage with the community when possible.

## Keyholders

While Quilt is a community project with concerns split across different teams, Discord (and some other platforms) is
designed with the core idea of a single community leader or owner in mind. For that reason, platforms that cannot be
run explicitly under team leadership alone must be "owned" by a keyholder.

A keyholder is a democratically elected member of the community that otherwise has no direct involvement or stake
in the management of the community. By electing an otherwise unrelated party to be a keyholder, it's hoped that the
Quilt community spaces can avoid the issue of a community leader gone rogue - it should prevent an abuse of power from
giving someone total control over any community space, at least as far as is possible.

After they've been elected, a keyholder does not need to be otherwise active in the community. All that's required of
them is that they're easily contactable (within reason), and that they're prepared to act in the event that something
happens that they will need to take care of.

Keyholder candidates should:

* Be able to show that they have no conflicting interests or personal wish to be in power
* Be known to a majority of the Community Team
* Have a clean, positive reputation in the Quilt community and wider modding community
* Have some accreditation or other guarantee of reputation in the wider modding community
* Regarding Discord specifically, they should be prepared to act as a liaison with the Discord team and to represent
  the Quilt community officially when interacting with them, including in the event of a partnership or working
  relationship with Discord
* Understand what's involved with keyholding, and be ready to step in when needed

Keyholders are not members of the Community Team, and they are not required to be obvious in the communities they
keyhold for - but they are free to make themselves known if they wish. They're also welcome to oversee the community
team in their actions and processes, and provide opinions and feedback if they wish.

## Basic Responsibilities

All members of the Community Team have the following responsibilities:

* To represent the Quilt project in an honest and respectful manner, and serve as an example of good behaviour in
  community spaces
* To participate in the processes that shape the Community Team, including voting on new team members and structural
  changes to community spaces (unless they're a Trainee Community Moderator - see below)
* To engage with the community authentically, being present and visible in the community when able and appropriate
* To be supportive of other Community Team members, providing insight, advice and support when able and appropriate
* To help with the planning and running of community events and projects, when able and appropriate

All team roles are additive - they add additional responsibilities on top of this basic set.

## Team Roles

Community Team members may have specific roles, which define additional responsibilities (and additional tools to meet
those responsibilities) on top of their basic responsibilities, as defined above. While the roles are intended to be
fairly balanced regarding their responsibilities, there is still likely to be some overlap - for example, Community
Managers also have the *ability* to moderate, if they're required to.

The role structure is intended to be flat, rather than an explicit hierarchy. Roles represent tasks and
responsibilities, rather than seniority. Roles may be assigned based on a number of criteria, including:

* Previous experience
* Staffing shortfalls or situational needs
* Suitability for the role
* Types of work the team member is offering to handle

### Community Managers

Community managers are responsible for day-to-day administrative tasks in Quilt community spaces, and take an active
role in the Community Team candidacy process. They're in charge of mobilizing and supporting the rest of the community
team, maintaining community spaces, and keeping everything running smoothly. Responsibilities include:

* Actioning changes to the structure of community spaces, or to community policies
* Aiding in conflict resolution and decision-making, especially when it comes to difficult moderation decisions
* Engaging with the community when they have questions, reports or issues, and working with them to address their
  concerns
* Facilitating the Community Team candidacy process by helping other team members to set up polls, and conducting
  interviews
* Maintaining informational channels, and writing and posting community-oriented announcements
* Managing any bots or other community-relevant automation tools
* Organising, training and supporting the moderation team, and acting as supplemental moderators as required
* Supporting the rest of the Community Team in their work, providing them with the tools and changes to community
  spaces that they need

Community managers must be appointed democratically, following the process outlined later in this document. If
required, the keyholders will handle handing out the permissions required for community managers to work in Quilt
community spaces.

### Community Moderators

Community Moderators are responsible for maintaining the safety and welfare of the members of the Quilt community by
enforcing the community policies, aiding in conflict resolution and dealing with problematic users and behaviours.
Responsibilities include:

* Aiding in conflict resolution between community members, and de-escalating heated situations
* Applying infractions for problematic behaviour or removing problematic users - in accordance with the community
  policies
* Collaborating with other Community Team members to ensure the smooth running of the community, and to ensure that due
  process is followed - in accordance with the community policies
* Engaging in active, honest participation in the Quilt community
* Engaging in the Community Team's democratic processes
* Helping members to find the correct community space for their query, and ensuring that other members don't prevent
  them from getting the support they need
* Keeping up to date on social issues (especially those that affect minority groups), and applying that knowledge to
  keep community members safe

Community Moderators must be appointed after a training period of no less than two weeks, graduating from their position
of Trainee Community Moderator after a review of their performance by the rest of the Community Team.

### Trainee Community Moderators

Trainee Community Moderators are new moderators that have been appointed as part of the process for electing team
members. They have a similar set of responsibilities to Community Moderators, and are "in training" - with oversight
and support provided by the rest of the Community Team.

The intention of this position is to provide new moderators with a buffer period, where they can feel more comfortable
seeking help and support from the rest of the Community Team. They're also publicly differentiated from the rest of
the moderation team, to ensure that community members understand that they're in-training and may make mistakes.
Trainee Community Moderators are expected to lean on the rest of the team, and to incorporate feedback given to them.
There is no requirement that they handle situations they're unsure about, or to make difficult decisions - these are
responsibilities assigned to Community Moderators and Community Managers.

Trainee Community Moderators should be excluded from the voting process until they graduate.

Trainee Community Moderators must spend at least two weeks in this position before they can be promoted to Community
Moderator, pending a review of their performance and discussion by the rest of the Community Team. Trainee Community
Moderators must be appointed democratically, following the process outlined later on in this document.

## Process: Voting on Changes

As Quilt is a community-run project and seeks to avoid the problems that come with single or small groups of people with
the very last, final say on everything, the Community Team implements a democratic approach for much of its processes.
This is detailed in this section - all other processes that involve votes should follow this process, unless otherwise
specified.

### Voting Process

1. The Community Team needs to discuss the subject matter of the vote beforehand, and discern whether a vote should
   take place to begin with - if it's decided that a vote will surely fail, then no vote is required and the motion
   can be dismissed immediately.
1. A poll is created in an internal channel that's designated for that purpose, either by posting a simple message or
   via a bot designed to facilitate polling. This poll should provide as much detail as possible, either directly in
   the poll message or by providing links and references - but it must be clear and not misleading, and the core idea
   must be present in the message instead of in the references.
1. Members of the Community Team may vote on the poll using the provided reactions. All polls should include a positive
   and negative option, as well as the option to abstain. Voting members that abstain are excluded from percentages and
   tallies.
1. Voting members are not required to explicitly explain their votes - major problems with the proposal should be
   worked out before the vote even begins, to avoid putting particular community members on the spot.

Polls must include a closing date of no less than one day and longer than one week, regardless of the proposal put
forward. At the time of posting, polls must also list the names of all eligible, eligible but inactive, and ineligible
voters, determined as described below. This list cannot change while the poll is still open, except in the case of an
inactive Community Team member (defined below) returning from inactivity.

### Closing Votes

Voting ends when any of the following conditions have been reached:

* The poll's closing date has been reached
* The poll has failed or passed early due to at least 75% of the voting members of the Community Team voting in that
  direction, excluding abstaining members from that count
* The special closing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

### Interpreting the Vote

When a poll has closed, the votes should be inspected. If the final vote has a margin of three votes or fewer,
the administrative board must be invited to vote on the poll, with their votes counting for three. If they've already
voted, they may change their vote or retract it, and their final vote will also count for three. The members of the
administrative board are not required to vote if they don't feel that it's necessary.

If any active voting members of the Community Team don't vote on the poll (unintentionally or otherwise), their vote
**must be counted as an abstention.** If a member is inactive (as defined below), they will not be counted as a
positive vote, negative vote, or abstention, and will not be counted in the tally for voting.

When taking into consideration plural systems, one system is treated as one voting bloc, regardless of individual
members, Discord accounts, or other factors. This is to ensure that a large system is not able to overpower the votes
of other Community Team members. If multiple votes are tallied on one poll originating from one system, all of the
system's votes will be removed and they will be asked to vote again. In the case that all of these multiple votes are
for the same option, all but one of the votes may be removed instead.

The Community Team should then tally the final vote counts, and interpret them as follows.

#### Failing conditions

The vote has failed when one of the following is true:

* The total number of _abstentions_ **is greater than or equal to** 25% of the count of voting members of the community
  team, rounding up to the nearest whole number
* The total number of _negative_ votes **is greater than or equal to** the number of _positive_ votes
* The special failing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

#### Passing conditions

The vote has passed when one of the following is true, but only if no failing condition has been met:

* The total number of _positive_ votes **is greater than** the number of _negative_ votes
* The special passing conditions specified as part of the specific process that this vote is part of have been met, if
  any

#### Other situations

As detailed above, there should be no situations where a vote ends in a tie. If a situation arises that the voting
process is unable to cover, the vote will fail and will need to be re-tried when the process has been amended.

### Determining voting eligibility

#### Community Team

All Community Team members are eligible to vote in polls, assuming they have been a member of the Community Team for
at least two weeks and are not a Trainee Community Moderator. Trainees, as well as Community Team members who have not
held their role for at least two weeks, are not voting members and should not be considered for internal votes. This is
to ensure that all voters have had some time to get familiar with the community and how it's run, but non-voting
members of the Community Team are always welcome to express their opinions and provide insight if they wish to.

Additionally, any Community Team member who has not interacted in any Quilt community space for more than two weeks,
internal or public, is considered inactive. Inactive members are not counted as a positive vote, negative vote, or
abstention, and will not be included in the tally for voting. These members are still eligible to vote in polls, but by
voting, they are no longer considered inactive.

#### Admin Board Members

Unless they're also a voting member of the Community Team, members of the Quilt Admin Board do note vote on internal
polls by default. Instead, they should only vote in order to break ties or contribute to inconclusive polls - votes
provided by members of the admin board are tripled, meaning that **one vote becomes three** - this is detailed in
[RFC 6: Governmental Structure](/community/0006-governance.md), as the admin board is the only parent of the community
team.

## Process: Changing Community Policies

While the policies themselves are out of scope for an RFC of this type, it's worth detailing the process the team
should follow when working on those policies. In most cases, the following steps should be taken when creating (or
amending) the community policies:

1. Discuss the changes with the community, if possible - in many cases, changes to community policy will be driven by
   feedback from the community's members, and interested community members should be included in the process
1. Discuss the changes internally (amongst team members) at first, to get an idea of what changes should be made
   and how they should be written
1. Work together to draft up the new/changed policy, accepting feedback from each other until the team members are
   largely happy with the changes - a full consensus is not required, but this process should continue until there
   are no major complaints
1. Publicise the draft, for the purpose of collecting feedback from the community and answering any questions the
   community members may have - this should be an active process that allows the community members to provide ideas
   and feedback for the community team to consider and utilize to update the publicised draft
1. After enough time has passed (usually a week) and enough feedback has been collected, finish implementing the 
   changes proposed by the community as appropriate, and integrate the changes - thus amending the working copy of
   the community policies and applying the policy changes to the Quilt community going forward
   
In some situations, smaller or more urgent changes to community policies must be made. Generally, this happens when a
loophole is found, or an important omission is made - in these cases, a faster turnover is more appropriate:

1. Changes like this are often made due to community feedback - if that is the case, communicate directly with
   concerned community members and bring their feedback directly to the community team for consideration
1. Discuss the change internally (amongst team members) and write up a draft, as detailed in the previous step - this
   should be a relatively quick process, as this approach is only appropriate for small or urgent changes
1. Once the community team is happy with the draft, take one of the following approaches:
    * For urgent changes, it's sometimes appropriate to implement the changes immediately with no feedback period
    * For other small changes, a shorter feedback period (usually a day) is usually appropriate

The approach taken is up to the discretion of the community team, but the latter approach should never be taken for
large or wide-reaching changes to community policy, and no change may be implemented without internal discussion.

In some cases, a more democratic process is appropriate - for example, asking community members to vote on an approach
to a given change or issue. An approach like this is acceptable if the community team reaches a consensus on the
process to be followed for it, as long as it keeps the community involved with the decision-making process.

**Remember:** Ultimately, the community team exists to serve the community, rather than the interests of its members.
Policy changes and additions should be created with the needs of the community and project in mind. Transparency and
accountability are important values to enshrine to ensure that this is always the case.

## Process: Changing the Structure of Community Spaces

From time to time, it may be necessary to change the structure of one of the community spaces - for example, the
channel layout on the official Discord server, or the organisation of categories on the wiki. As our spaces exist
to serve the community that makes use of them, these changes should always be made while involving the community in
the process:

1. Once the need for change has been identified, inform the community of that need - explain why the change needs to
   happen and, if possible, propose one or more possible approaches
1. Once the need for change has been adequately brought to the attention of the community, give the community members
   time to provide feedback if they wish to - set a time limit based on the urgency of this change, but no more than
   a week and no less than a day
1. After the feedback period has ended, collect the feedback provided by the community, discuss it internally, and
   work towards a decision - a full consensus is not required, but this process should continue until there are no 
   major complaints, and in some cases it may be appropriate to return to the community feedback phase before it's
   possible to move ahead
1. Once the team has finished discussing, implement the change and, if multiple approaches were suggested by the
   community members, inform the community on why this approach was ultimately decided upon 

## Process: Electing Team Members

As our primary communication space is the official Discord server, Community Team member appointments should be
processed on Discord. Quilt's Community Team members are elected using a democratic internal process:

1. Members of Quilt community spaces may apply to join the community by contacting the Community Team directly. The
   preferred contact method for this is by making use of the ModMail system on Discord.

    * Alternatively, candidates may be put forward by other members of the Community Team, after some internal
      discussion. This may be a result of observations made by the Community Team, suggestions from community members,
      or otherwise - but the Community Team should always discuss before putting forward a candidate, and they should
      ensure that the candidate is actually interested in the position they're being put forward for.
    * Plural systems may apply collectively or individually. Due to Discord's limitations and as a result of system or
      individual preference, multiple accounts may end up being given Community Team roles from a single application.
      If a Discord account is shared between multiple system members, duties do not necessarily need to be carried out
      by all members.
1. Candidates must be interviewed by a Community Manager before the election process can continue. All voting members
   of the Community Team should be given access to the interview space, and other voting members of the Community Team
   are welcome to give their opinions on the content of the interview, or present their own questions after the
   Community Manager giving the interview opens the floor to them.
1. After an interview has taken place, a vote should be proposed, following the voting process outlined earlier in this
   document. This poll should last for exactly one week, with the following special conditions:

    * The vote has **failed** when:
        * The margin between positive and negative votes is less than or equal to 20% of the number of voting community
          members, excluding abstentions and rounding up to the nearest whole number.

   The poll should include the user's history in the community and their reputation in the wider modding community, if
   known. It should also include the specific position they're applying for.
1. Once the vote has closed, the candidate should be contacted by a community manager and given the result, which will
   decide whether their application was successful.

    * If the vote (and thus application) has failed, the candidate should be given feedback on their interview and
      any actionable concerns should be provided. Candidates with failed applications should not be excluded from
      applying again, but their next application should be at least a month after their previous one.

    * If the vote (and thus application) has passed, the Community Manager overseeing the application must provide the
      applicant with any documentation they need, ensure they're ready to join the Community Team now, and provide them
      with any roles and access that their new position requires. The Community Manager should also help the new
      team member to settle into their position, support and train them as necessary, introduce them to the
      development teams, announce their appointment to the community, and provide information on the structure of the
      internal communications channels.

**Remember:** If the candidate is applying for a moderation-related role, they must always go through a training
period as a Trainee Community Moderator. This is required for all Community Moderator and Community Manager positions,
but is not required for positions without enforcement duties, such as event organisers.

### Points to Consider

Voters (and those that are considering putting forward a candidate) should consider the following points when forming
their opinion:

* Does the candidate actually want to join the Community Team?
* Does the candidate have a good understanding of the Quilt community policies?
* Does the candidate have any known problematic behaviour outside the Quilt community?
* How active is the candidate in the Quilt community?
* How does the candidate choose to interact with other community members? How do they interact with the Community Team
  in comparison?
* How does the community perceive the candidate? Do they mesh well with the rest of the community?
* How has the candidate contributed to the Quilt community and project so far?
* How well does the candidate fit into the Quilt community's culture?
* What is the candidate's infraction history? Have they been infracted for anything serious?
* Would any community members be uncomfortable if the candidate were to be elected? If so, why?

Of course, there are likely to be additional considerations to keep in mind - voters should always bring up anything
that concerns them about an applicant, and criticisms are not limited to the above list.

## Process: Changing/Adding Roles

Each Community Team member has a specific set of responsibilities and tasks to keep in mind. These are assigned based
on the role they currently occupy, but there's no reason for any Community Team member to be unable to move between
roles later on if they wish, or take on additional responsibility if they're able.

Any Community Team member wishing to change their role or take on another role must go through the election process
for that role again. A special ModMail thread must be created - which they must not be able to access from the internal
interface - and the interview process should continue as normal from there.

Voting should be handled as detailed in the election process above, but the Community Team member in question should not
be counted in the voting tallies or percentage of voters. If the Community Team is applying for a moderation-related
role - and they haven't gone through the Trainee Community Moderator process - they must always go through a training
period as a Trainee Community Moderator.

Community Team members switching roles or taking on additional roles must not be treated preferentially to any other
types of candidates. It's important, therefore, that the rest of the community team holds its members accountable
during this process.

## Process: Removing Team Members

Eligible voters are decided in allignment with
[RFC 6: Governmental Structure](/structure/0006-governance.md#removal-of-staff) (anyone above or below), but a
counterargument is not required or expected before voting or removal of staff permissions. Instead the call to action,
discussion, and voting can occur in a private channel/dm visible to eligible voters, and if it succeeds the removed
staff can submit a counterargument asking the decision be overturned after the fact.

---

Community work is something that can change significantly over time, especially as the topics and behaviours that our
modern society deems appropriate change. Community policies, processes and approaches will need to change in order to
keep up to date with this - all members of the community team should be prepared to learn as they go.
