# Summary

This document exists to describe the formation of a team that handles Quilt's community management tasks. It makes 
reference to **the Quilt community**, which may be defined as all official Quilt community spaces, including(but not 
limited to):

* The QuiltMC GitHub organisation and repositories
* The official Quilt Discord server
* The official Quilt wiki

**Note:** Unordered lists in this document have been alphabetized to emphasise the fact that, in most cases, entries
in those lists are of equal importance.


# Motivation

Community management is an extremely important task, especially so for community-driven projects like Quilt. 
Maintaining a healthy community should always be a top priority, and a team should be formed to handle Quilt's
community aspects as best it can.

While most of the work the community team will do will not be directly relevant to Quilt's development efforts,
its members must be prepared to deal with issues in development-related spaces that fall within the team's scope.

## Advantages and Benefits

A community-driven project exists to serve its community's needs. The only way this is an achievable goal is to
maintain a healthy, safe and involved community - with dedicated community spaces, and a dedicated management team.

It should be understood that an active, healthy community has many benefits - not all of which are easy to enumerate
in a document, or which directly concern the project in an obvious way. That said, the following benefits should be
fairly observable from an active, healthy community:

* A higher chance of obtaining sponsorships that allow the project to grow beyond its technical bounds
* A larger pool of feedback to work with, as well as more opportunities to work with the community on solutions to
  issues
* A larger pool of potential contributors, for development projects and otherwise
* Improved project recognition and reputation within modding spaces, as well as within the wider development- and 
  game-related spaces worldwide
* More opportunities for collaboration with the rest of the modding community
* More opportunities to improve the modding ecosystem as a whole
* More opportunities to support the members of our community in ways that are meaningful to them


# Explanation

The community team will be in charge of maintaining the Quilt community spaces, as detailed in the summary. It will
be responsible for drafting up, accepting comments on and implementing community policies, interacting with and
protecting the community and its members, and resolving conflicts and enforcing the community policies.

## Process: Changing Community Policies

While the policies themselves are out of scope for an RFC of this type, it's worth detailing the process the team
should follow when working on those policies. In most cases, the following steps should be taken when creating (or
amending) the community policies:

1. Discuss the changes with the community, if possible - in many cases, changes to community policy will be driven by
   feedback from the community's members, and interested community members should be included in the process
1. Discuss the changes internally (amongst team members) at first, to get an idea of what changes should be made
   and how they should be written
1. Work together to draft up the new/changed policy, accepting feedback from each other until the team members are
   largely happy with the changes - a full consensus is not required, but this process should continue until there
   are no major complaints
1. Publicise the draft, for the purpose of collecting feedback from the community and answering any questions the
   community members may have - this should be an active process that allows the community members to provide ideas
   and feedback for the community team to consider and utilize to update the publicised draft
1. After enough time has passed (usually a week) and enough feedback has been collected, finish implementing the 
   changes proposed by the community as appropriate, and officiate the changes - thus amending the working copy of
   the community policies and applying the policy changes to the Quilt community going forward
   
In some situations, smaller or more urgent changes to community policies must be made. Generally, this happens when a
loophole is found, or an important omission is made - in these cases, a faster turnover is more appropriate:

1. Changes like this are often made due to community feedback - if that is the case, communicate directly with
   concerned community members and bring their feedback directly to the community team for consideration
1. Discuss the change internally (amongst team members) and write up a draft, as detailed in the previous step - this
   should be a relatively quick process, as this approach is only appropriate for small or urgent changes
1. Once the community team is happy with the draft, take one of the following approaches:
    * For urgent changes, it's sometimes appropriate to implement the changes immediately with no feedback period
    * For other small changes, a shorter feedback period (usually a day) is usually appropriate

The approach taken is up to the discretion of the community team, but the latter approach should never be taken for
large or wide-reaching changes to community policy, and no change may be implemented without internal discussion.

In some cases, a more democratic process is appropriate - for example, asking community members to vote on an approach
to a given change or issue. An approach like this is acceptable if the community team reaches a consensus on the
process to be followed for it, as long as it keeps the community involved with the decision-making process.

**Remember:** Ultimately, the community team exists to serve the community, rather than the interests of its members.
Policy changes and additions should be created with the needs of the community and project in mind. Transparency and
accountability are important values to enshrine to ensure that this is always the case.

## Process: Changing the Structure of Community Spaces

From time to time, it may be necessary to change the structure of one of the community spaces - for example, the
channel layout on the official Discord server, or the organisation of categories on the wiki. As our spaces exist
to serve the community that makes use of them, these changes should always be made while involving the community in
the process:

1. Once the need for change has been identified, inform the community of that need - explain why the change needs to
   happen and, if possible, propose one or more possible approaches
1. Once the need for change has been adequately brought to the attention of the community, give the community members
   time to provide feedback if they wish to - set a time limit based on the urgency of this change, but no more than
   a week and no less than a day
1. After the feedback period has ended, collect the feedback provided by the community, discuss it internally, and
   work towards a decision - a full consensus is not required, but this process should continue until there are no 
   major complaints, and in some cases it may be appropriate to return to the community feedback phase before it's
   possible to move ahead
1. Once the team has finished discussing, implement the change and, if multiple approaches were suggested by the
   community members, inform the community on why this approach was ultimately decided upon 

---

Community work is something that can change significantly over time, especially as the topics and behaviours that our
modern society deems appropriate change. Community policies, processes and approaches will need to change in order to
keep up to date with this - all members of the community team should be prepared to learn as they go.
