# RFCs
This folder is for general RFCs that don't fit into the other folders.
An RFC fits here if the following are true:
- It is not in the scope of any other folders
- It is not meant to be updated over time (For example, the RFC may be a high-level description of a major change in how Quilt is developed, such as Hashed Mojmap or CHASM, but will not be kept updated as the feature adapts from RFC to actual implementation).
