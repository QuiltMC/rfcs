This template is intended to serve as a guideline for what should be included
in the typical RFC. Some of this may not be relevant to all RFCs, and that's
fine, but it's best to follow this template where possible. (Delete this
paragraph from your actual RFC.)


# Summary

One paragraph explanation of this suggestion. Don't go into too much detail
here; that goes in the explanation section. This should just give readers a
general idea of what this RFC does.


# Motivation

Why should we do this? What are the benefits?


# Explanation

Explain this change in detail. This section will be different depending on what
sort of change it is.

For technical changes, such as changes to APIs, first give an overview of how
this proposed change would work. Explain how it would be used, with code
examples. Then, give a more in depth explanation of how it would be implemented
and how it would interact with other parts of the project and other Quilt
projects.

For social changes, such as changes to community guidelines, governance, or the
RFC process itself, this section should explain how the new rule or process
will work. Be thorough and clear here, so that everyone can have the same
understanding of this suggestion.


# Drawbacks

Why should we not do this?


# Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this the best possible design?
- What other designs are possible and why should we choose this one instead?
- What other designs have benefits over this one? Why should we choose an
  alternative instead?
- What is the impact of not doing this?


# Prior Art

If this has been done before by some other project, explain it here. This could
be positive or negative. Discuss what worked well for them and what didn't.

There may not always be prior art, and that's fine.


# Unresolved Questions

- What should be resolved before this RFC gets merged?
- What should be resolved while implementing this RFC?
- What unresolved questions do you consider out of scope for this RFC, that
  could be addressed in the future?


# Expected Response

How do might the wider community respond to this change? Who will be affected
by it and how? Who has advocated for this change? Who has advocated against it?
